projects using Tensorflowjs 


The main concept behind TensorFlow.js is easy ML anywhere, Nowadays our computers have become powerful as well as our browsers too
we can run ML algorithms, Train, import Models, update the model easily using Tensorflow.js

this is a Classification project on IrisDataset which i performed on Tensorflow.js

Requirements:
1.webserver for chrome
2.Html editor ( Brackets)
3.chrome browser
the beauty of the Tensorflow.js is we can work on chrome while the model is running in the background (asynchronous)
